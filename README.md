# UAS Operation Manual Template

This repository contains a template for a UAS Operation Manual. See Section One of [CAP722A](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP722A-UASOSC.pdf) for more information.  

An Operations Manual (Op-Man) is required when submitting an application to the CAA for Operational Authorisation. (i.e. you need prepare this document before getting a drone license in the UK.)

[COPTRZ](https://coptrz.com/) provides a template to people taking their GVC course, but it is written using Microsoft Word.  

This repository is for rewritting that template so that it uses the freely available TeX typesetting system.  

All rights for the orginal template belong to Coptrz (blah blah blah... don't sue me).
